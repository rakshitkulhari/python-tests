    "1. by using functons we  don't have to write large programs we can complete the task by simply using functions.\n",
    "2. we can use function multiple times instead of writing code again and again\n",
    "3. we don't have to show how the functions does only user has to know that what the function is doing , so we don't have to show complex details\n",
    "4. its easier to debug in functions because we can do the testing and debuging independently.\n",
    "5. many of functions are well named so its easier to understand what does the block of code actually doing."
